          Dr. Kory from the start of the COVID-19 global pandemic has kept patient care front and center as he had to learn along with the rest of the medical world how to understand SARS COV-2 infection impact, how to treat patients and save lives. He has proven to be a quick and accomplished study after searching out information from across the globe collaborating with some of the best medical professionals in their specific areas of medicine and research. To now be a patient seeking best in class medical care and have Dr. Kory be able to personalize my care using his expertise is invaluable to me. I highly recommend Dr. Kory if you are suffering from any stage of illness or disease related to COVID-19. Best MD and best cost for services value (even without insurance accepted!) of the many I have seen since my infection in 2020..

          Michael Webster called me right on schedule and was very pleasant to talk with. We revied my current medications as well as the supplements Im taking. After a discussion of my health history, he made a COVID Rx early treatment recommendation to me based on my personal situation. After he walked me through the treatment plan, we discussed the pharmacy options and were able to make a quick decision. Im grateful for the service that Dr. Kory, Michael Webster, and the rest of their team is providing (all via telehealth) at this critical time for so many of us.

He made sure my questions were answered and that I knew how to make contact if needed. Scott left me feeling heard, cared for, educated and supported. Just wonderful. This is an exceptional, professional service I highly recommend. Dr. Kory and Scott, your team is the best. I follow every Wednesday update and have referred many to you and the FLCCC site. Be encouraged and know I am praying for you. -- Julie

          Thank you for providing this service! My telehealth appointment with Scott was wonderful! Not only did he listen to my concerns regarding my particular comorbidity issues, but he had excellent suggestions for therapeutics that might help. He also adjusted the Covid-19 protocol dosages to fit my particular needs as opposed to doing a "one size fits all" method. It is a huge relief to know I will be able to have these medications on hand in case I do come down with Covid. Thank you very much for being there!

          $250, initially, seemed like a lot of money to get set up with this service. however, after talking with Scott and being able to discuss anything under the sun, it was well worth the price of admission. If you’re not planning to get the shots, I strongly recommend going through this process. Hats off to Dr. Kory for his perseverance and sticking to his guns throughout the last two years.

          If I could give Dr. Kory 5,000 ⭐️s I would. He was on time and had read my history ahead of time. Dr. Kory listened and worked with me to address my concerns, rather than just telling me what to do. He wanted to make sure we are on the same page and that I was comfortable. Bottom-line, Dr. Kory is AWESOME … and he is taking new patients!!!

          Thank you Dr Kory for an excellent tele-visit. Dr Kory is a very knowledgeable and detail oriented doctor. I would strongly recommend Dr Kory. I visited Dr Kory due to long-haul covid lung issues I am still having seven months after the acute phase of covid and all the other doctors I have been visiting dont know how to treat it. I have hope again that I will get back to a more normal health in time. Thanks!

          It was a relief to speak to someone with expertise in treating Covid and get answers to my particular issues. The entire process was quick and efficient. I would highly recommend them.

          The process was so easy for setup. I was so very impressed with the level of knowledge of the NPG, Scott. We went through the supplements I take and he helped me understand where I could improve or change. It was a nice experience. While Ive read through the FLCCC protocols it was very helpful to discuss details and ask questions about specifics.
